# OpenElections Sources IL

Source files for Illinois election results. Many of the files in this repository were contributed by [Michael W. Sances](http://umdrive.memphis.edu/msances/www/), an assistant professor of political science at the University of Memphis, who obtained them for his dissertation research on local elections. His research was [funded by the National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1223187). OpenElections is grateful for his generous contribution towards our work.
